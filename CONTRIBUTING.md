# Contributing
Hi, and thanks for considering contributing! Before you do though, here's a few notes on how best to contribute. Don't worry, I'll keep it short!

## Issues

- Report issues or feature requests on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mattbanks/jQuery.equalHeights/issues).
- If reporting a bug, please add as much detail as possible (server environment, browser, expected behavior, actual behavior, code examples, etc)

## Pull requests
- Create a new topic branch for each change you make.
- Create a test case if you are fixing a bug or implementing an important feature.
- Run `grunt` locally to generate a new minified version and lint the plugin.
- Open a Pull Request against the `develop` branch with a clear title and description.

## Examples
- If changing the Examples, create a pull request against the `gh-pages` branch.

## Caveats
- Don't bump the version, as one of the core plugin contributors will manage that to push out changes to Bower.
